#saurik-svn-mirror
saurik is a software engineer, he has wrote many opensource programs such as Cydia,Cycript.
He put his source code on on two svn server: `http://svn.saurik.com/repos/menes/` `http://svn.telesphoreo.org/trunk/`
The two url access are slow in china. I upload to github so that others can get a faster connection.
