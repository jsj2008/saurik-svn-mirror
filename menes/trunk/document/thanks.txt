Douglas W. Thrift (douglas@douglasthrift.net):
   Maintains the FreeBSD port and actually _uses_ menes for his projects, thereby making his testing/comments invaluable.

Patrik Husfloen (redoz@redoz.com):
   Christened menes-szf and has been an important source of feedback and test cases throughout the development process.

Andrei Alexandrescu (andrewalex@hotmail.com):
   Wrote a kick ass book (that I've never read, but still), and pioneered a lot of the concepts that were used in Menes.

Rani Sharoni (rani_sharoni@hotmail.com):
   Came up with a really, really cool unbounded IsFunction<> implementation that Menes uses.

Pierre Terdiman (p.terdiman@wanadoo.fr):
   Developed the technique for the floating point radix sort. Is also an insanely productive coder and good source of inspiration.

Bjarne Stroustrup (?@?):
   Designed the language that I've come to love and that has been a critical link in the tool chain for most of the work I've done.

Patrick J. LoPresti (p...@cag.lcs.mit.edu):
   One of the only sane people that has ever piped up on in thread related discussions.
