To use type "make", and then run "main <probe file>".

To switch between diffuse lighting, texture debugging, and multi-shadow mapping, you use '1'/'2'/'3'.

You use my somewhat crazy mouse rotation scheme to rotate things, holding down the Right button.
Initially, you rotate the camera (which is centered to the scene).
You can switch rotation between the Camera, the Torus, the 2nd Torus, the Ground, and some of the lights with 'c'/'t'/'p'/'g'/'l'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'.
To zoom in/out you hold both the Right and Middle mouse buttons and move Up/Down.

To quit the program, you use 'q'.

To see from the camera's perspective, press '['.
To see from various light's perspective, press ']'.
